I attempt to develop a model that generates abstract art from raw sketches by  collecting a number of abstract art images and pre-process it to generate sketch-like images using edge-detection techniques. Our deep learning model then trains these sketch-like images (dependent variable, Xs) so as to generate the abstract images (independent variables, Ys) using image-to-image models.
